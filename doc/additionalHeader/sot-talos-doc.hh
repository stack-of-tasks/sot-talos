\section sec_intro Introduction

This library implements a class called Device for the TALOS PAL-Robotics
humanoid robots to be controlled with the Stack-Of-Tasks. A derived class is
used for the first prototype of this line of humanoid robot, Pyrene.

This class is implementing a perception-action loop.
To achieve this goal it is providing a Hardware Abstract Layer to communicate
with the SoT control infra-structure and the robot or a simulator. It is fully
compatible with the roscontrol_sot package to run on a TALOS humanoid robot or
with the Gazebo simulator.

The sot-talos package contains also the class sot-talos-controller. This class
is used to start the multithreading environment which is handling ROS request,
starts the python interpreter to control the SoT and finally handle the control
states: initialization, nominal usage, stopping or cancellation.

It also provides python scripts to be used to interact with the robot.

\section SoTTalosDevice
